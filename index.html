    <h3 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3> 
  <ul>
<li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>
<li>
<strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the
"National Youth Administration"
</li>
<li>
<strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
</li>
<li>
<strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
Forestry Service
</li>
<li>
<strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
pest-resistent plants.
</li>
<li>
<strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
other applied science.
</li>
<li>
<strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
</li>
<li>
<strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
varieties for each major climate on Earth.
</li>
<li>
<strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
season, doubling wheat yields
</li>
<li>
<strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
</li>
<li>
<strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
</li>
<li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
<li>
<strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
increase their maize and sorghum yields
</li>
<li>
<strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&amp;M
University
</li>
<li>
<strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
people were selecting the best breeds."
</li>
<li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
